                <p>
                  Shrinking margins and an increasingly competitive market put a lot of pressure on the modern farmer:
                  Pressure to maximise profits by improving the efficiency of your operations, and squeezing everything
                  you can out of your agricultural equipment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We offer a dedicated tractor remapping service that's designed to help you do just that â€“ boosting
                  the power, torque and fuel efficiency of your machinery so that you:
                </p>
                <ul class="points">
                  <li>Spend less time in the field</li>
                  <li>Waste less money on diesel</li>
                  <li>Get more done with your day</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Because we hand-programme remaps to account for the exact requirements of an individual vehicle, the
                  exact gains will depend on the make, model and year of your tractor. However, most customers see a
                  substantial increase in torque (NMM) and power (BHP), better fuel economy and more tractability.

              <h1 class="sec-heading text-sec">How Does Tractor Remapping Work?</h1>
              <p>
                Tractor remapping is a relatively involved practice, but the underlying concepts are simple.
                Irrespective of whether you're driving a Massey Ferguson 6480, an NH T7 or a brand new Lamborghini
                Spire, your vehicle's engine is managed by a palm-sized computer that controls everything from fuel
                injection to idle speeds.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sometimes called the ECU (engine control unit) or ECM (engine control module) this tiny computer uses
                pre-programmed software called a â€˜map' to monitor and regulate your engine's behaviour.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unfortunately, the overwhelming majority of tractors roll out of the factory with a default map that
                imposes artificial limits on your vehicle's power and torque. This is because most modern
                manufacturers need to be sure that their tractor will perform equally well in farming environments as
                diverse as the Texas Panhandle, sunny Central Europe and the subtropical rice terraces of Southern
                China.
              </p>
              <p>
                That means coping equally well in freezing or arid conditions, persistent high humidity and baking hot
                temperatures.
                <br>
                But if you're farming here in the AUS and you take good care of your equipment, these limitations are
                probably wholly unnecessary.
                <br>
                Fortunately, your manufacturer's default map can be replaced with software that's been programmed to
                optimise the way your engine runs; allowing us to recover previously inaccessible reserves of power and
                torque.
              </p>
              <p>
                We can also unlock more torque at the lower end of your rev range; allowing you to work at a lower RPM
                and decreasing overall fuel consumption. You'll also be able to move up and down the field faster, and
                slow/turn your tractor in higher gears, improving overall drivability and significantly increasing the
                efficiency of both yard and field operations

              <h1 class="sec-heading">Is Tractor Remapping Safe?</h1>
              <p>
                We understand that agricultural equipment is a long-term investment. You need it to perform well in the
                field, but it's equally important that your tractors are fully usable for the duration of their rated
                lifespan and don't need to be replaced prematurely.
              </p>
              <p>
                As such, we hand-programme maps for every make and model in our database â€“ taking great care to ensure
                that we're not pushing your agricultural machinery beyond the OEM's stated tolerances.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our maps won't have a negative impact on the reliability of your machinery, and we're so confident
                in their quality that we offer a lifetime guarantee against software malfunctions. We'll also back up
                your manufacturer's original map on our servers so that you can restore it at any time.
