                <p>
                  The overwhelming majority of modern motorcycles have a significant amount of untapped potential.
                  There's no question that manufacturers want to build bikes that provide an enjoyable ride and plenty
                  of power, but they're often hampered by the need to create bikes that perform equally well in a
                  multitude of different environments; from the scorching heat of death valley to the wet and windy
                  reaches of North West Scotland.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Modern manufacturers are also hampered by the need to meet increasingly stringent emissions
                  regulations and performance parameters set by marketing executives who are invested in establishing a
                  clearly-tiered product range, and not at all interested in ensuring that individual models of bike are
                  tuned for peak performance.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As such, it's no surprise that a significant percentage of fuel injected motorbikes roll out of the
                  factory with de-tuned engines're running software that's actually designed to limit the amount of
                  power delivered to your back wheel.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Fortunately, there is a way to remove these limitations and unleash your bike's true potential.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This process is known as ECU remapping, ECU tuning or ECU flashing. In simple terms, we reconfigure
                  the computerised tables (or maps) that your bikes in-built computer (or ECU) uses to that manage your
                  engine â€“ tweaking parameters, altering torque curves and changing the way your bike responds to
                  inputs so that you can access more power (bhp) and torque (Nm) without pushing your engine too far.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Think of it as fine-tuning your bike's engine to optimise power delivery in real-world conditions.
                  In some cases, our tweaks will also unlock more power at the bottom end of your rev range, which is a
                  real boon if you do a lot of city driving.

                Remapping your motorbike's engine can also improve throttle control and the overall quality of your
                ride. If you've ever found yourself battling with a snatchy throttle, struggling to pull away smoothly
                in the wet or battling power surges at the bottom of your rev range, a specialist ECU remap is a great
                place to start.
              </p>
              <p>
                And if you're already well on your way to solving some of these problems with aftermarket upgrades
                like a new exhaust, air intake or filter system, remapping your engine is the single best way to ensure
                that your bike's inbuilt computer can take advantage of these upgrades.
              </p>
              <p>
                When we sit down to write a remap, we have a unique opportunity to ensure that your fuel pressure,
                air-fuel ratios and are optimised for the parts that are actually installed on your bike â€“ rather than
                the ones that shipped from the factory.
              </p>
              <p>
                The results of a remap do depend on the exact make, year and model of your bike but most of our clients
                see a 10-30% boost in bhp and a significant increase in ride quality.

              <h1 class="sec-heading">How Does Motorbike Remapping Work?</h1>
              <p>
                Modern motorbikes are complicated machines; carburettors and other analogue components have been
                replaced by sophisticated computers that are responsible for managing the performance of your engine.
              </p>
              <p>
                Every time you squeeze your throttle, hundreds of sensors fire - sending data about the air temperature
                and manifold pressure, cam and crank speed to computers that make split-second decisions about your
                ignition timing or fuel pressure.
              </p>
              <p>
                Of all these computers, the ECU or engine control unit is definitely the most important. The â€˜brain'
                of the modern bike, this palm-sized component takes inputs from all over your machine, and uses a series
                of spreadsheet tables or â€˜maps' to fine-tune your bike's performance on the fly.
              </p>
              <p>
                When we remap a bike, we change the data in these tables; altering the way that your ECU responds to
                inputs to smooth out power delivery, alter torque curves and tweak things like air-fuel ratios to ensure
                that we're getting 100% of your engine's potential.
