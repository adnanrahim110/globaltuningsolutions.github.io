              <h1 class="sec-heading">The Removal Procedure</h1>
              <p>
                The normal procedure is to remove the internal filter from the exhaust system, leaving the outer
                casing in place. The procedure begins by disassembling the exhaust system from the vehicle. A small
                window is then cut in the top or engine facing side of the DPF canister, the internal filter is then
                removed. After removing all of the internal filter the window is welded back into position and the DPF
                canister and exhaust system is refitted to the vehicle. It is also possible to fit DPF bypass pipes
                for those that wish to keep the original DPF canister intact.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once the physical filter removal has been completed then we will reprogramme (Remap) your ecu and any
                DPF related structures removed from the vehicles software. This will prevent the vehicle from sensing
                the missing filter and will prevent future DPF regeneration and DPF related warning lights. This is
                the most important aspect of the removal process and it is vital that the ECU is reprogrammed
                correctly or DPF issues will continue. When carrying out this process we can also Remap the ECU for
                better performance and fuel efficiency at a discounted price, please let us know if you would also
                like a quotation for this upgrade.

                Removing the DPF from your vehicle is not only a cost effective solution but it also boasts the

              <h1 class="sec-heading">EGR Bypass / Removal / Delete</h1>
              <p>
                Stringent emission targets set by the Governmental bodies have forced vehicle manufactures to develop
                new methods of improving the emissions of a vehicle. One such development is the EGR (Exhaust Gas
                Recirculation) system. Unfortunately the manufacturers were forced to take a compromise. This was to fit
                an EGR valve to reduce the emissions of the vehicle, but compromise on the efficiency and reliability of
                the engine.
              </p>
              <p>
                By recirculating exhaust gasses back into the combustion chamber during low engine loads the combustion
                temperatures are reduced and in turn reduce the NOx (Nitrogen Oxide) emissions. Failure often occurs
                when the dirty exhaust gasses clog up the valve causing it to stick in the open position, when this
                happens the engine is starved of oxygen and becomes sluggish and inefficient, in some cases the vehicle
                can become almost undriveable. The EGR valves can also fail electronically when the internal motor or
                position sensors fail.
              </p>
              <p>
                The consumer is now becoming wise to the negatives of the EGR system, becoming tired of the expensive
                repair bills and reliability issues they cause. Therefore, we offer a full EGR bypass / removal service
                which results in better efficiency and less maintenance costs. Our EGR removal service boast's the
                following:
              </p>
              <ul class="points flexible d-flex flex-wrap">
                <li>More Power</li>
                <li>Better Fuel Efficiency</li>
                <li>Improved Throttle Response</li>
                <li>Less Flat Spots</li>
                <li>Cleaner Intake System and Engine</li>
                <li>Reduced Maintenance Costs </li>
                <li>Prolonged Engine and Turbo Life</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                There are two aspect to the EGR Removal service. First the EGR Valve is blanked preventing any exhaust
                gasses from passing through the valve and entering the intake system (EGR blanking is only required when
                the valves cannot fully close due to carbon build up or motor failure). Secondly, the ECU is Remapped
                (Reprogrammed) and the EGR functions are removed from the ECU software or the valve is electronically
                programmed to remain closed at all times. This is the most important aspect of the service and it is
                vital that itâ€™s done correctly. We can also remap the vehicle for better performance and fuel efficiency
                at the same time.

              <h1 class="sec-heading">P Code / Fault Code / DTC Delete</h1>
              <p>
                Permanently removing fault codes from the engine management system is a very useful process when
                modifying a vehicle. Removing components such as swirl flaps, EGR valves, other modules etc.. for
                purpose of performance modification or motorsport will often cause a fault code to be stored in the ECU
                memory along with lights on the dash and limp mode. By recoding the ECU data and permanently removing
                the specific fault code we can prevent the dash lights from being displayed and prevent the vehicle from
                entering limp mode.

              <h1 class="sec-heading">AdBlue (SCR) Removal</h1>
              <p>
                AdBlue is a chemical liquid used in Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) on diesel vehicles in order to
                reduce NOx levels. The AdBlue fluid (Diesel Exhaust Fluid) is injected into the exhaust system just
                before the SCR catalyst. The introduction of AdBlue into the exhaust gasses generates a chemical
                reaction inside the SCR Cat which results in NOx being converted into Nitrogen and Water Vapor. AdBlue
                was introduced by vehicle manufacturers in order to hit the stringent emission targets set out by
                governmental bodies.
              </p>
              <p>
                The AdBlue and SCR system is a relatively complex system with an array of electronic sensors, modules
                and pumps, these systems can fail and can be expensive to maintain. A vehicle which is used on a regular
                basis will consume a large amount of AdBlue and the tank will need to be refilled on a regular basis.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our AdBlue delete service will electronically disable the AdBlue system along with removing the
                associated dashboard lights and warning messages. Disabling the AdBlue system is normally completed by
                reprogramming the engine management system. Some vehicles will require a small adjustments also but will
                be notified by us upon file uploading.
              </p>
              <p class="notice">
                Before committing to a AdBlue delete check your local laws to see if you are legally permitted to have
                your AdBlue system removed.

              <h1 class="sec-heading">Inlet Manifold Swirl Flap Removal / Delete</h1>
              <p>
                Swirl flaps are small butterfly valves located within the inlet manifold on modern diesel and petrol
                engines, they are designed to help regulate the fuel to air ratio, improve emissions and help generate
                better torque at low engine speeds. At light engine loads the flaps close, causing the air to swirl into
                the combustion chamber, the swirling affect aids combustion and helps to improve emissions and generate
                more torque. After 2000 rpm the flaps are generally activated to a fully open position and have very
                little effect on engine performance and emissions.
