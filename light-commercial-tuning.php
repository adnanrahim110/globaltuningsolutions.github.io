                <p>
                  It doesn’t matter whether you’re driving a Golf GTI MK 7, a Mercedes Sprinter, or a 2018 Range Rover
                  L405: A hand-crafted ECU remap is almost always the simplest and most effective way of increasing your
                  vehicle’s performance.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By carefully recalibrating the software responsible for managing your engine, we can help you squeeze
                  more power (BHP) and torque (NM) out of your engine, as well as eliminating poor throttle response,
                  removing flat spots, and smoothing out power delivery to ensure that your vehicle operates at peak
                  performance without compromising reliability.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you’re driving a diesel car or light commercial vehicle, an ECU remap can also boost your fuel
                  economy (MPG) by providing more torque at the bottom of your rev range, allowing you to pull away with
                  less throttle and move up through your gears more efficiently.

                <h1 class="sec-heading">ECU Remaps – Designed For Reliability</h1>
                <p>
                  People used to (incorrectly) assume that ECU remapping was the preserve of die-hard petrol heads,
                  obsessed with wringing every last drop of power from cars. But most people now understand that remaps
                  are one of the safest and most reliable ways to improve your vehicle’s performance.
                  <br>
                  We work hard to ensure that every map is sensitive to the limitations of its intended recipient,
                  accounting for the peculiarities of individual engines and writing software that’s capable of
                  maximizing efficiency without sacrificing reliability or putting too much strain on delicate parts.
                  <br>
                  We also write and test our maps using a top-of-the-line Mainline AWD chassis dyno to ensure that we’re
                  unlocking your vehicle’s true potential.
                  <br>
                  We’re so confident in the quality of our ECU remaps that we offer a lifetime guarantee against
                  software malfunctions or failures. We’ll also store your manufacturer’s default map on our servers so
                  that you can restore it at any point, providing peace of mind and ensuring that you’re in full control
                  of your car or light commercial vehicle.

              <h1 class="sec-heading text-sec">What Can I Expect From An ECU Remap?</h1>
              <p>
                The exact benefits conferred by a remap depend on hundreds of interrelated variables related to the
                make, model and year of your car but you can generally expect to see significant gains in power and
                torque. The overwhelming majority of our customers also report that remapping their vehicle has
                transformed their driving experience.

              <h1 class="sec-heading">How Does ECU Remapping Work?</h1>
              <p>
                Modern engines are managed by a complex web of interconnected components and sensors that are
                responsible for managing everything from air/fuel ratios to the power distribution, ignition timing and
                the idle speed of your car.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the heart of these complex systems sits the ECU or engine control unit; a palm-sized metal box that
                contains the software programme (or maps) that tell your engine how to behave in response to inputs from
                sensors scattered all over your car.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most manufacturers ship ECUs with fairly standard maps; designed to ensure that their vehicles perform
                in a variety of very different environments. Mercedes need to ensure that their newest E-Class works
                equally well in the subtropical climates and the snow.
              </p>
              <p>
                Modern manufacturers also need to account for customers who won't service their vehicles
                regularly, and customers who use sub-optimal fuel - which is why they often tone down performance and
                impose artificial limitations on your engine's capabilities.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unfortunately, these limitations can be quite severe. By writing a new map and reprogramming your ECU,
                we can unlock an engine's full potential and tweaking settings to unlock previously
                inaccessible reserves of power and torque.
              </p>
              <p>
                We can also tweak the settings that govern your power band or power curve, engine timing, fuel pressure
                and other variables to optimise performance and ensure that your car drives and handles as well as it
                possibly can.
