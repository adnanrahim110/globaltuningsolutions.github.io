                  Most will argue that the DSG gearbox is one of the finest auto gearboxes available on the market
                  today. Its ability to change gear in a fraction of a second and predict the drivers next move is a
                  master piece of engineering. However, like with all OEM systems it can be restrictive. Our custom DSG
                  Remap is designed to remove these restrictions and adjust the settings to compliment the more
                  performance minded driver.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our custom DSG Remapping service will alter the following parameters / options:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Increased torque limiter</strong><br>
                    When tuning the engine management system torque limiters are increased, however if the vehicle is
                    equipped with a DSG gearbox the engine output will be limited by the torque limiter set in the DSG
                    module. We raise the DSG torque limiter to match the engine torque output.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Quicker Shift Speeds</strong><br>
                    Shift speeds can be increased by up to 20%, this reduces lag and improves acceleration. The quicker
                    shift speeds will also give a smoother transition between gear changes and improve paddle shift
                    response time.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>RPM Limits & Shift Set Points</strong><br>
                    RPM limits and shift set points can be adjusted in drive and sports mode. Adjusting the rpm limiter
                    as part of the engine ECU remap is not enough on a DSG equipped vehicle. The DSG ECU will determine
                    at what rpm the gear shift takes place.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Launch Control</strong><br>
                    Launch control can be activated (model specific). Launch control will allow your car to make the
                    perfect launch every time, reducing your 0 â€“ 100 time and increasing the fun factor.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Full Manual Mode</strong><br>
                    Even when in manual mode stock DSG software will force the gearbox to change up or kick down etc.
                    With our custom DSG Remap we are able to give the driver full control by preventing auto changing
                    when in manual mode (Model Specific).
