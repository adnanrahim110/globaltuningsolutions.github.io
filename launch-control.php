                  Launch control is designed to help the driver generate a quick launch from stand still. Too much power
                  and the vehicle will wheel spin, too little and the engine will bog down. Our launch control remap
                  option limits the low speed rpm, thus limiting the power to the wheels, once the vehicle begins to
                  increase in speed and traction has been established full power is activated.
                </p>

                  Currently our launch control remap is limited to only a few models. Cars equipped with a DSG gearbox
                  will require a DSG Remap in order to activate launch control. Please contact us for further
                  information.
